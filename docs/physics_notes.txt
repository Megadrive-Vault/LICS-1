Lyle in Cube Sector physics notes
---------------------------------

Lyle:
= Physics =
Walking top speed: 1.7px/f
Max fall speed: 8px/f
X accel/decel: 0.15px/f^2
Y accel due to gravity: 0.23px/f^2
Jump strength: -3.7px/f
Jump hold str: 0.1px/f ?

When lyle is hurt, perform a short jump, set X velocity = 1.9px/f

= Animations =
Cube kick / throw anim length: 8 frames
Time until CP spawn particles appear: 5 frames
Time until CP spawn occurs: 60 frames
Time until fast CP spawn occurs: 30 frames
Time until a cube is lifted: "15" frames (effectively 12...)

Cubes:
= Physics =

Collision tests:
Box collision determines generally if there is a collision
(check all four corners)

if (cube at all touches a solid background)
	if (tile below center of tube is solid) and (dx != 0)
		if (dy > 2) and (tile inside X center of cube is nonsolid)
			dy = 0.72 * dy;
			count--;
		else if (dy <= 2) and (count is > 1)
			dy = -2;
			count--;
		else if (count <= 1)
			make cube stop; lock y coords to 8x8 grid

	if (dx != 0) and (tile immediately above cube is solid) and (tile 8px below cube is nonsolid)
		dy = 3;

	if (tile dead center in cube is solid) and (dx != 0)
		dx = dx * -1;
		count = 1;
		dy = 3;
	


Then, if the tile immediately below the cube is solid and dy > 2, 
	dy = (dy - (0.28*dy);



Y accel due to gravity:
	dy = dy + 0.2;
Dy mod when cube bounces on the ground: 
	if dy > 2, dy = (dy - (0.28*dy);
	c--;
Cube bounces on another cube:
	dy = (dy - (dy * 0.28)) - 0.75;
	dx = 1;
Cube is stuck overlapping another:
	dy = -4 for one cube only;
Cube kick speed:
	dx = 3;
Cube hits backdrop after kick:
	dy = -0.3;
	dx = 1
