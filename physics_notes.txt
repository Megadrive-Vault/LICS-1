Lyle in Cube Sector physics notes
---------------------------------

Lyle:
= Physics =
Walking top speed: 1.7px/f
Max fall speed: 8px/f
X accel/decel: 0.15px/f^2
Y accel due to gravity: 0.23px/f^2
Jump strength: -3.7px/f
Jump hold str: 0.1px/f ?

When lyle is hurt, perform a short jump, set X velocity = 1.9px/f

= Animations =
Cube kick / throw anim length: 8 frames
Time until CP spawn particles appear: 5 frames
Time until CP spawn occurs: 60 frames
Time until fast CP spawn occurs: 30 frames
Time until a cube is lifted: "15" frames (effectively 12...)

Cubes:
= Physics =
Y accel due to gravity:
	dy = dy + 0.2;
Y mod when cube bounces on the ground: 
	if dy > 2px/f, dy = (dy - (0.28*dy);
Cube bounces on another cube:
	dy = (dy - (dy * 0.28)) - 0.75;
	dx = 1px/f;
Cube is stuck overlapping another:
	dy = -4 for one cube only;
Cube kick speed:
	dx = 3px/f;
Cube hits backdrop after kick:
	dy = -0.3px/f;
	dx = 1px/f
