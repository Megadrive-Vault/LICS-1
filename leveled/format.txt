LYLE IN CUBE SECTOR MD LEVEL FORMAT DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------

Header:

typedef struct level_header level_header;
struct level_header
{
	// Dimensions in terms of screens (40x32 tiles)
	u16 w;
	u16 h;

	// Position on the map for the top-left of the level
	u8 map_x;
	u8 map_y;

	// Selections for level appearance
	u8 tileset;
	u8 pal;
	u8 bg;

	// Bitfield for various options (boss room, etc)
	u16 flags;
};

Following the header is the map data, stored as 16-bit words ready to be copied
to the plane mapping in VRAM.

Immediately afterwards is the object list. Each object is 8 bytes, and the list
is at most 128 entries long (1 KiB). The game will parse it to populate the 
game's runtime object list in work RAM, but it is not parsed at any othe time.

Objects like the orbs and bosses are treated specially. If a BOSS has already
been marked as defeated, it will not load (which boss is dictated by the flags
bitfield.) The same goes for the orbs.

typedef struct level_obj level_obj;
struct level_obj
{
	// Object type and flags/param
	u16 type;
	u16 flags;

	// Coordinates in real position (not blocks)
	u16 x;
	u16 y;
};
