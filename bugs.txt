KNOWN BUGS
----------

Lyle can sequence break by standing next to the blocking green cube, and 
tossing the other one into the ceiling while he faces right. It will hit
him and force him into the ceiling a bit, after which he can get on top of
the blocking cube and move it without kicking at all. This may be okay, as
it only blocks off one CP orb.

If Pilla falls too fast, he'll get lodged in the ground. Need to add some
push-out sensitivity. 

Lyle's cube magic counter isn't reset when he is hit. Maybe okay? Can allow
for some odd techniques to be used.
